  'title': 'Novel PGK1 determines AR stability dependent on Spk2 and reprograms granular cell glucose metabolism to facilitate ovulation dysfunction',
  'gds_type': 'Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing',
  'summary': 'Ovulation disorder is the main characteristic of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), but the concrete molecular mechanism is unclear. Phosphoglycerate kinase 1 (PGK1) plays an important role in the process of glycolytic cycles. Androgen and androgen receptor (AR) are considered as one of the critical factors in the prevalence of hyperandrogenemia and follicular development, and whether PGK1 participates in the metabolic reaction via AR in PCOS remains vague. PGK1 and AR proteins were highly expressed in PCOS luteinized granulosa cells and the PCOS-like mice ovary tissues. PGK1 increased lactate levels and deteriorated PCOS-like mouse metabolic disorder, and importantly, the phenotype of PCOS-like mice was rescued by PTX (paclitaxel) and the PGK1 and AR protein levels also decreased in the ovary. We demonstrated that PGK1 promoted AR translocation into the nuclear, and PGK1 was dependent on the E3 ligase Skp2 to repress the AR ubiquitination to improve the AR stability. In addition, we found that follicular development critical genes MAP2K6, KLF15, LRIG3 and MYOF were regulated by the PGK1-AR axis in the RNA-seq data, and axis also mediated cell proliferation and apoptosis. This study highlights the glycolysis key gene PGK1 to regulate metabolism in granular cell result in etiology of the PCOS. The PGK1-AR axis might provide a new therapy target of PCOS',

  'title': 'Prenatal Androgenization Alters the Development of GnRH Neuron and Preoptic Area RNA Transcripts in Female Mice (I)',
  'gds_type': 'Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing',
  'summary': 'Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is the most common form of infertility in women. The causes of PCOS are not yet understood and both genetics and early-life exposure have been considered as candidates. With regard to the latter, circulating androgens are elevated in mid-late gestation in women with PCOS, potentially exposing offspring to elevated androgens in utero; daughters of women with PCOS are at increased risk for developing this disorder. Consistent with these clinical observations, prenatal androgenization (PNA) of several species recapitulates many phenotypes observed in PCOS. There is increasing evidence that symptoms associated with PCOS, including elevated luteinizing hormone (LH) (and presumably gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH)) pulse frequency emerge during the pubertal transition. We utilized translating ribosomal affinity purification coupled with RNA sequencing to examine GnRH neuron mRNAs from prepubertal (3wk) and adult female control and PNA mice. Prominent in GnRH neurons were transcripts associated with protein synthesis and cellular energetics, in particular oxidative phosphorylation. The GnRH neuron transcript profile was affected more by the transition from prepuberty to adulthood than by PNA treatment, however PNA did change the developmental trajectory of GnRH neurons. This included families of transcripts related to both protein synthesis and oxidative phosphorylation, which were more prevalent in adults than in prepubertal mice but were blunted in PNA adults. These findings suggest that prenatal androgen exposure can program alterations in the translatome of GnRH neurons, providing a mechanism independent of changes in the genetic code for altered expression.',

  'title': 'Next Generation Sequencing Analysis of exosomes in follicle fluid of PCOS/non-PCOS patients',
  'gds_type': 'Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing; Non-coding RNA profiling by high throughput sequencing',
  'summary': 'Purpose: the goals of this study are to identify the transcriptome profiling of exosome derived from follicle fluid of PCOS patients by next-generation sequencing (NGS). Methods:the transcriptome profiling of exosome derived from follicular fluid of five PCOS and five control patients were generated by deep sequencing, using Illumina GAIIx. The sequence reads that passed quality filters were analyzed at the transcript isoform level with two methods: Burrows–Wheeler Aligner (BWA) followed by ANOVA (ANOVA) and TopHat followed by Cufflinks. qRT–PCR validation was performed using TaqMan and SYBR Green assays Results: the transcriptome profiling including circRNA, lncRNA and mRNA were comparatively analyzed in the two groups of exosomes (exo-PCOS and exo-control). We focus on the circRNAs profile for further analysis. A circRNA candidate was considered to be differentially expressed if its levels between both experiment groups showed a statistically significant difference (p<0.05) of at least two-fold. Based on this criterion, we identified 16 differentially expressed circRNAs (5 up-regulated and 11 down-regulated circRNAs) between exo-PCOS and exo-control, including 3 annotated exonic circRNAs and 13 novel ones. Clustering analysis based on the differentially expressed circRNAs clustered the exo-PCOS and the exo-control groups (control). Conclusion: the circRNA expression profile of exosome derived from follicular fluid of five PCOS and five control patients were determined by RNA sequencing technology. 16 circRNAs showed significantly different expression in the exosome of PCOS FF. GO and KEGG pathway analysis indicated that the parental genes of the candidate circRNAs were involved in ovarian steroidogenesis, aldosterone synthesis and secretion, thyroid hormone signaling pathway, ubiquitin mediated proteolysis, Jak-STAT signaling pathway, and endocytosis pathway.',

  'summary': 'To investigate the molecular mechanism of PCOS underlying the hyperandrogenic phenotype, prenatally androgenized (PNA) mice were used to mimic this phenotype in women with PCOS. Methylated DNA binding domain sequencing (MBD-seq) and RNA-seq were performed on PNA mice (n=6) and control group (n=4) and validations were applied on ovarian samples from PNA mice (n=6) and control group (n=6) using MSP (methylation-specific PCR) and qPCR. The immunohistochemistry (IHC) and transmission electron microscope (TEM) profiling was separately conducted on tissue sections and granular cells of PNA mice (n=6) and control group (n=6). We identified 857 genes with differently methylated promoters and 3317 differently expressed genes in PNA mice and control group. We found that PCOS group had a down-regulation of Dnmt1 gene expression, accompanied by global hypomethylation compared with the control group. The promoter regions of Map3k1(mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase 1) and Map1lc3ka (microtubule-associated protein1 light chain 3) were hypomethylated, accompanied by up-regulation of their mRNA expression, which may be involved in the regulation of PCOS through MAPK/p53 pathway activition and autophagy alteration.',

  'summary': 'Normal-weight polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) women exhibit adipose tissue dysfunction in vivo accompanied by enhanced subcutaneous (SC) abdominal adipose stem cell (ASC) development to adipocytes with greater lipid accumulation per cell in vitro. The goal of this study was to determine whether this phenomenon is associated with abnormal adipogenic gene transcription using RNA-sequencing to examine differential transcription patterns in PCOS vs controls. We found enhanced activation of adipogenic and adipocyte function genes and decreased expression of genes within the Wnt signaling pathway. In this study we conclude that this altered expression of genes in PCOS cells may underlie their exaggerated lipid accumulation in vitro and could predispose to adipose dysfunction in vivo when caloric intake exceeds energy utilization.\u2003',

  'summary': 'Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) is characterized by hyperandrogenism, irregular ovulation and polycystic ovaries. In the present study, we utilized integrated analysis of whole transcriptome and DNA methylome by reduced representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS) and RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) of the fetal side of placenta in women with PCOS. A cluster of neural function related genes, such as LIN7A and MAP1B, were identified with integrative analysis of methylome and transcriptome. Inflammatory disease and response process were spotlighted with GO enrichments analysis of differentially transcriptional gene cluster in PCOS, and the cellular growth and the development and function of nervous and endocrine system were also closely related to PCOS. With respect to neural function, the enriched GO terms in differential expressed gene cluster of PCOS group involved brain development, the proliferation and differentiation of neural precursor cell, neuron and neuroblast. Consistently, the enriched GO terms in differential methylated gene cluster of PCOS group were associated with neuropeptide and synaptic transmission, as well as cognition and learning or memory. As the gene expression changes in hypothalamus and hippocampus probably result in long standing neurobehavioural consequences in rodents, we conducted a global analysis of transcriptomic data of F1 pubertal female rats born to PCOS rats.',
